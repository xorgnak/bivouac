## Blockchain building, one block at a time.
##  This will create a first block with fake transactions
## and then prompt user for transactions informations and set it in a new block.
## 
## Each block can take multiple transaction
## when a user has finish to add transaction, 
##  the block is added to the blockchain and writen in the ledger
